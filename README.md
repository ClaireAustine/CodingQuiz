# Coding Quiz
####     This is a simple coding quiz that I built to further understand javascript.
 
The quiz displays multiple choice questions about coding one after another when the start button is clicked and will start a 60 second timer. The timer will remove 10 seconds with each question anwsered incorrectly. At the end of the quiz users can submit their initials or name to be saved in highscores and can view highscores by clicking on "Highscores". The Highscores page displays users initials and scores which is the time remaining once they've completed the quiz, and has a link back to the quiz.
